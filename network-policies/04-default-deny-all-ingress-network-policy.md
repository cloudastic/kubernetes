# Default deny all ingress traffic

## CNI Plugins
Before delving into the Network Policies in Kubernetes, we should briefly learn about the `CNI (Container Network Interface) Plugins`
* You need a `CNI Plugin` installed on the Cluster for the Network Policies to take effect. 
* There are [several CNI Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy) available in the market, and all of them are supposed to implement the [Kubernetes network model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model) but they differ in some aspects like support for varying networking needs, Performance, Security, Infrastrcture constraints and many more. 
* Various Cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, GCP and others have the CNI Plugins pre-installed by default. 


## Network Policies
* `Network Policies` are namespaced kubernetes resources. 
* They are used to control the flow of traffic between the pods and different network entities. 

## Demo

Let us now block all the incoming traffic 'ingress' to the middleware namespace.

[<img src="img/deny-incoming-traffic-on-middleware-namespace-2.gif" width="80%" />](img/deny-incoming-traffic-on-middleware-namespace-2.gif)

### Default deny all ingress for middleware namespace
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -n middleware -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```

Now lets try to connect to the `middleware` pod from both the `webapp` and `mysql` pod.

## [Inbound connection] : Connect from webapp to middleware pod
```
kubectl exec -it -n frontend webapp -- curl -m 3 $(kubectl get pods middleware -o wide -n middleware -o jsonpath="{.status.podIP}")
```

## [Inbound connection] : Connect from mysql to middleware pod
```
kubectl exec -it -n backend mysql -- curl -m 3 $(kubectl get pods middleware -o wide -n middleware -o jsonpath="{.status.podIP}")
```

Both the ingress requests have now timed out, clearly indicating that incoming traffic to the `middleware` namespace is blocked. Let us now try to establish outbound connection from the `middleware` pod to other pods in `frontend` and `backend` namespace.


## [Outbound connection] : Connect from middleware to webapp pod
```
kubectl exec -it -n middleware middleware -- curl -m 3 $(kubectl get pods webapp -o wide -n frontend -o jsonpath="{.status.podIP}")
```

## [Outbound connection] : Connect from middleware to mysql pod
```
kubectl exec -it -n middleware middleware -- curl -m 3 $(kubectl get pods mysql -o wide -n backend -o jsonpath="{.status.podIP}")
```

Well!, the outbound connections from the `middleware` pod is working without any issues. 
How do we restrict the Outbound connections then ? 
Its done through the Network Policy with the policy type 'egress'.


## Use-cases:

* Network isolation could be done either through blacklisting / whitelisting approach. 
* The `default deny` policies are used as a best practice to knock down all the communications in first place. Once this baselining is applied, you can then add the whitelist on top of it to create exceptions. This way, you block everything first and then allow only those trusted connections. 
* Network Policies should be a key component of Kubernetes cluster security, but they are not a silver bullet since they don't offer deep traffic inspection like an enterprise-grade firewall. However, by enabling only trusted connections between resources, you effectively reduce the attack surface of the cluster.
